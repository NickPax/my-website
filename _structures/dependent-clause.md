title: The Dependent Clause
---

* Has a subject and verb and also an **introductory word(s)**, without which a dependent clause would be a sentence:  



| He laughed. | ... **when** he laughed |  
| It rained. | ... **because** it rained |  
| The concert finished. | ... **as soon as** the concert finished  

<br/>

### Examples of dependent clauses (in parentheses)  

<br/>

Nelly the elephant was set free (when she recovered in October).  

Adverb clause at end of sentence, hence no commas.
{: .grey}   

<br/>  



Nelly the elephant was set free, (when she recovered in October), by the African team.  

Adverb clause in the middle of what it modifies, hence the commas.
{: .grey} 

<br/>
<br/>  
Dependent clauses can function as the following:  
<ins>a noun</ins>  
>My question is this: Where is the body?  (is an appositive to "this")  
Note: "A dependent clause does not stand alone to express a complete thought" --BGGP p. 17

<ins> an adjective</ins>  
Did he pick the one that you wanted? (modifies one)    

<ins> an adverb</ins>  
The car stopped when the lights changed.  (modifies stopped)  

The dependent clause is doing something. It is being the *subject* or *direct object* or modifying part of the sentence.  

  

### Note the difference between a phrase and a clause in these examples:  

<br/>

I met the band *before the gig*.
>prepositional phrase  


<br/>


I met the band *before they played the gig*.  
>dependent clause


<br/>


He has not left his house *since last Friday*.   
>prepositional phrase  


<br/>


He has not left his house *since he returned*.  
>dependent clause  

<br/>
<br/>


* With the exception of the following words --    

| how | why | what | 
  
-- for noun clauses, all dependent clauses begin with   

| a relative pronoun or | a subordinate conjunction |

<br>
 
### The elliptical clause  
* Has **subject** and/or **verb** missing.  
* But is punctuated as though they were present.  
<br/>

Examples:

*If necessary*, please call the help line.
> If **it is** necessary ...  

<br/>  

*As expected*, they all went home.
> As **was** expected ...


### Dashes and dependent clauses  

Use a dash or a pair of dashes when a noun clause is a nonessential appositive.  

Example:  

You are forgetting one thing -- that the car was still running.

After the stormy weather -- great hail balls and rain -- they went outside.  

When a noun clause is used to rename the subject at the end of a sentence, use a dash.  

Example:  

This is the most important fact in this evidence -- that the extension period had elapsed.

### Other points about dependent clauses  

An adverb clause at the end of a sentence usually does not require punctuation.  

Example:  

He looked up because of the noise it made.  

And when the adverb clause comes after a noun clause -- even in the middle of a sentence -- add no punctuation.  

Example: 

Where he went *after the meeting* nobody knows.  

And when an adverb clause comes after another adverb clause at the end of a sentence, again use no punctuation.  

Example:  

Mr Brigstock was looking confident as he praticed the riff before going on stage.

HOWEVER ...  

If the adverb clause is not directly related to the content of the part of the sentence in which it is used, add a comma.  

Examples:  

The firm has a no-smoking policy throughout the campus, even though no one really smokes these days.  

The team had organised a huge ad hoarding and placed the content in full view, although you couldn't really see it.
