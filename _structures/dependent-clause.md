title: The Dependent Clause
---

* Has subject and verb and also an introductory word, without which an dependent clause would be a sentence
Examples: [make a table]
He laughed.  ...when he laughed
It rained.   ...because it rained
The concert finished.  ...as soon as the concert finished

More Examples of deps:
The elephant was set free when she recovered in October.
>adverb clause at end of sentence, hence no commas. [PUNCT?]bonus info: "hence here is acting like the phrase "which leads to" or "which is the reason of" so there is a comma. Hence can't join two indy clauses because it normally acts as an adverb, and soit would either start a sentence or come after a semicolon.
The elephant was set free, when she recovered in October, by the African team.
>adverb clause in the middle of what it modifies, hence the commas.

I met the band before the gig.
>prep phrase  

I met the band before they played the gig.  
>dependent clause

He has not left his house since last Friday.   
>prep phrase
He has not left his house since he returned.  
>dep clause

* watch out for the elliptical clause
-- has subject and/or verb missing.
-- but is punctuated as though they were present.
Examples:

If necessary, please call the help line.
> If it is necessary ...  

She types faster than I.  
> ...faster than I do.  

As expected, they all went home.
> As was expected ...

* with the exeption of   
how  
why  
what  
for noun clauses, all dependent clauses begin with  
a relative clause or  
a subordinate conjuction
