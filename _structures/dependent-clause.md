title: The Dependent Clause
---

* Has a subject and verb and also an **introductory word(s)**, without which a dependent clause would be a sentence:  



| He laughed. | ... **when** he laughed |  
| It rained. | ... **because** it rained |  
| The concert finished. | ... **as soon as** the concert finished  

<br/>

### Examples of dependent clauses (in parentheses)  

<br/>

Nelly the elephant was set free (when she recovered in October).
>adverb clause at end of sentence, hence no commas.   

<br/>  



Nelly the elephant was set free, (when she recovered in October), by the African team.
>adverb clause in the middle of what it modifies, hence the commas.  

<br/>
<br/>  
Dependent clauses can function as the following:  
<ins>a noun</ins>  
>My question is this: Where is the body?  [...]

<ins> an adjective</ins>  
Did he pick the one that you wanted? (modifies one)    

<ins> an adverb</ins>  
The car stopped when the lights changed.  (modifies stopped)  

The dependent clause is doing something. It is being the *subject* or direct object* or modifying part of the sentence.  

  

### Note the difference between a phrase and a clause in these examples:  

<br/>

I met the band (before the gig).
>prepositional phrase  


<br/>


I met the band (before they played the gig).  
>dependent clause


<br/>


He has not left his house (since last Friday).   
>prepositional phrase  


<br/>


He has not left his house (since he returned).  
>dependent clause  

<br/>
<br/>


* With the exception of the following words --    

| how | why | what | 
  
-- for noun clauses, all dependent clauses begin with   

| a relative pronoun or | a subordinate conjunction |

<br>
 
### The elliptical clause  
* Has **subject** and/or **verb** missing.  
* But is punctuated as though they were present.  
<br/>

Examples:

If necessary, please call the help line.
> If **it is** necessary ...  

<br/>  

As expected, they all went home.
> As **was** expected ...
