title: Conjunctive Adverb
---

* When at the beginning of an independent clause, it functions as a conjunction linking two clauses.  

>The computer is not switched on; therefore, it will not work.   


* If it's within an independent clause it will be functioning as an adverb, parenthetically or as a modifier.  

>The computer, however, was not switched on.

Here are some common conjunctive adverbs:  


| accordingly | in fact | hence |
| also | indeed | plus |
| besides | likewise | so (meaning therefore) |
| consequently | moreover | still |
| furthermore | nevertheless | then |
| however | otherwise | thus |
| in addition | therefore | yet | 


A good way to identify whether or not you're dealing with a conjunctive adverb is to think of it as linking back to what was previously said. It would not, therefore, actually start a conversation, e.g.: "Thus the program ended." With this in mind you can differentiate it from being a plain adverb or parenthetical.
