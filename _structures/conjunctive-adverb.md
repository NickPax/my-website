title: Conjunctive Adverb
---

When at the beginning of an independent clause, it functions as a conjunction linking two clauses.  

E.g. The computer is not switched on; therefore, it will not work.   


If it's within an independent clause it will be functioning as an adverb, parenthetically or as a modifier.  

E.g. The computer, however, was not switched on.

Here are some common conjunctive adverbs:  


| accordingly | in fact | hence |
| also | indeed | plus |
| besides | likewise | so (meaning therefore) |
| consequently | moreover | still |
| furthermore | nevertheless | then |
| however | otherwise | thus |
| in addition | therefore | yet | 


A good way to identify whether or not you're dealing with a conjunctive adverb is to think of it as linking back to what was previously said. It would not, therefore, actually start a conversation, e.g.: "Thus the program ended." With this in mind you can differentiate it from being a plain adverb or parenthetical.

## Comma before "yet"? {#comma-before-yet}  

Consider this sentence:  
He wrote the lyrics, yet could not remember them.  

The comma replaces "and".  
according to BGGP, "yet" is a conjunctive adverb and as such is NOT used in the same way as a coordinate conjunction.  

But when "yet" (or another conjunctive adverb) links two *independent* clauses, we use a period or a semicolon:  
E.g. He wrote the lyrics; yet he could not remember them.  

And if we have a coordinate conjuction in the mix, we use the comma:  
E.g. He wrote the lyrics, and yet he couldn't remember them.  
He wrote the lyrics and yet couldn't remember them.
