title: Conjunctive Adverb
---

* When at the beginning of an independent clause, it functions as a conjuction linking two clauses.
* If it's within an independent clause it will be functioning as an adverb, parenthetically or as a modifier.

Here are some common conjunctive adverbs:  


| accordingly | in fact | hence |
| also | indeed | plus |
| besides | likewise | so (meaning therefore) |
| consequently | moreover | still |
| furthermore | nevertheless | then |
| however | otherwise | thus |
| in addition | therefore | yet | 

<br/>

Examples:  
As a conjuction: The computer is not switched on; therefore, it will not work.  
And parenthetically: The computer, however, was not switched on.
