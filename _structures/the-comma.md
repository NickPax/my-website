title: The comma

#### Use a comma in the following situations:  

At the beginning of a sentence, after any form of single-word parenthetical.  
E.g. Now, how did you find the room?  
Well, that went well.  
Oh, I see you're wearing red too.    
Then, like, we just took off.  

After an introductory prepositional phrase that contains a dependent clause.  
E.g. For all I know, they drove south.  

After an introductory prepositional phrase that contains an adverb clause.  
E.g. If necessary, finish it now.  

After an introductory prepositional phrase that contains a verbal.  (Phrases with a gerund, participle, or infinitive)  
E.g. After reaching a verdict, please return to this courtroom.   

After a long (four or five words) prepositional phrase at the front of the sentence.  
E.g. In the very late afternoon, the sun came out.  

But do not use a comma after a short prepositional phrase at the beginning of a sentence.  
E.g. In the afternoon it started to snow.  

Also, use a comma if there are two or more prepositional phrases at the beginning.  

And use a comma after an introductory prepositional phrase if it has commas inside it.  

Use a comma when the introductory element **could not possibly start a new conversation**.  
E.g. In conclusion, let's go over the party list.  

When the introductory phrase is parenthetical.  
E.g. By the way, do you smoke?  

Anytime for clarity.  
E.g. Before, they were married.  
I think not, for five of us were there.    

<br/>
Do not use a comma here:  
When two sets of subjects and verbs share a common element.  
E.g. The boss needs to know and I need to know what time you got here.  

When single words or short word groups begin the sentence.  
E.g. Recently he's been fine.  
In late fall we decided to move.  
Yesterday evening it started snowing.  

<br/>  

Random examples of comma use:  
Before and after the year -- or NOT -- when only month and year are written.  
E.g. The gig in March 2018 was good fun.  
After what happened in February, 1999, the calls for appeal wained.  

With city or state plus the Zip code, keep them as a unit and surround with commas. However if a city-state unit, with or without a Zip code is an adjective, a comma is optional before the noun it modifies.  
E.g. This tastes like a New York, New York pizza.  

Washington, D.C.
