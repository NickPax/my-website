* Use a comma in the following situations:  

At the beginning of a sentence, after any form of single-word parenthetical.  

Examples:  
mwwex: Well, it was certainly enough to frighten all of us.  
Oh, there were probably 15 of us.  
Gee, it was five or six weeks later.  

Then, like, we never did get to go on those trips.  
Now, did you accompany him to tha bank that day?  
You know, like, he was just a jerk.  

After an introductory prepositional phrase that contains a dependent clause.  
After an introductory prepositional phrase that contains an adverb clause.  
After an introductory prepositional phrase that contains a verbal.  (Phrases with a gerund, participle, or infinitive)
After a long (four or five words)  prepositional phrase at the front of the sentence.
But do not use a comma after a short prepositional phrase a the beginning of a sentence.  
Also, use a comma if there are two or more prepositional phrases at the beginning.
And use a comma after an introductory prepositional phrase if it has commas inside it.
Use a comma when the introductory element could not possibly start a new conversation.  
When the introductory phrase is parenthetical.
Examples:
mwwex: 
In conclusion, I want to point out the circumstances around this incident.  
However, he had to get his marriage anulled before he could move forward.  
For all I know, he could be anywhere now.
In the afternoon we saw her again.  
By the way, he often took naps even though he was supposed to be working.  
In the very late afternoon, we saw her again.  
If necessary, finish it now.  
When he arrived, he went straight to work.  
After reaching a verdit, you will return to this courtroom.   
On the afternoon of the 12th, we saw her again.  
For long, long periods, she did not speak to anyone outside the family.  

## Comma with "yet" -- see [here] ({{site.baseurl}}/structures/coordinate-conjunction)

Anytime for clarity.  

mwwex: Before, he worked for charity.  
I think not, since he has to be here anyway.  

<br/>
Do not use a comma here:
-- When two sets of subjects and verbs share a common element.
E.g. The company needs to know and the state needs to know what services are provided to these clients.
