#### Use a comma in the following situations:  

At the beginning of a sentence, after any form of single-word parenthetical.  
E.g. Now, how did you find the room?  
Well, that went well.  
Oh, I see you're wearing red too.    
Then, like, we just took off.  

After an introductory prepositional phrase that contains a dependent clause.  
After an introductory prepositional phrase that contains an adverb clause.  
After an introductory prepositional phrase that contains a verbal.  (Phrases with a gerund, participle, or infinitive)  
After a long (four or five words) prepositional phrase at the front of the sentence.
But do not use a comma after a short prepositional phrase at the beginning of a sentence.  

Also, use a comma if there are two or more prepositional phrases at the beginning.  

And use a comma after an introductory prepositional phrase if it has commas inside it.  

Use a comma when the introductory element **could not possibly start a new conversation**.  

When the introductory phrase is parenthetical.  
E.g. By the way, do you smoke?  
If necessary, finish it now.  
When he arrived, he went straight to work.  
However, this was impossible.  
For all I know, they drove south.

In the afternoon it started to snow.  
In conclusion, let's go over the party list. 
In the very late afternoon, the sun came out.  
 
 After reaching a verdict, you will return to this courtroom.   
 


#### Comma with "yet" -- see [here]({{site.baseurl}}/structures/coordinate-conjunction/#comma-with-yet)   

Anytime for clarity.  
E.g. Before, they were married.  
I think not, for five of us were there.    

<br/>
Do not use a comma here:  
When two sets of subjects and verbs share a common element.  
E.g. The boss needs to know and I need to know what time you got here.
