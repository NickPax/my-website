## Yes and No  

Use a period after yes or no in Q&A when the answer provides additional information.

mwwex: >Did you see her earlier in the day?

A  Yes. She had left with her sister.  
A  No. I had to leave before she arrived.  

* if the words after yes or no simply echo the words of the question, use a comma.  

mwwex: >Did you see her earlier in the day?
A  Yes, I did.  
A  Yes, I saw her.  
A  No, I didn't.  
A  No, I did not see her.  

* When the words after yes or no begin with a but, and, because, though, etc. use a period.  
mwwex:  
Did you see her earlier in the day?  
A  Yes. But we didn't speak at the time.
A  Yes. Because she had something I needed.  
A  No. And not the next day either.  
A  No. Nor anytime later.  



## Polite requests  

These ask a person to do sth or provide info.  

mwwex:
>Would you put your initials on the diagram at the point where you were parked.  

>Will you hand that to your witness.  

* It is an extension of the command form.  
Will you be here tomorrow at 9:00 or not?  
Would you please arrive tomorrow at 9:00.  

* Yes or no cannot be the only response to a polite request.  

Correct:  
Q  Would you state your name.  
A  Yes. Jane Doe.  (The yes alone wouldn't work as a meaningful answer.)  

* They usually start with "will" or "would".  

Will you state your name for the record.  

Q  Will you give me your husband's name.  


* Can or could imply someone's ability to do something. When that is the meaning, a question mark is correct.  

>Can you walk?  

But when those words are used to ask someone to do sth, use a period.  

mwwex: Could you pick that up for me.  

Can you read that first page to yourself.  

* Sometimes the witness's response helps determine the meaning:  

mwwex:  
Q  Can you give me the names of all the people in the room?  
A  No, I cannot. I do not know them.  

Q  Can you give me the names of all the people in the room.  
A  John, Charles, Marilyn, Brent, and Bruce.


### Okay, all right, very well, etc.  

When such words come at the beginning of a sentence, place a period after them, even if there are several strung together. Also use a period when they come at the end of the sentence as a complete thought.  

Examples: mwwex:  

Okay. What happened next?  
All right. Very well. Please tell me more about what happened that day after you got the letter.
