title: The infinitive phrase

* Always "to" plus a verb.  
* Looks like a verb but can act like an adjective, adverb, or a noun.  
* Starts with an infinitive and may include an object and modifiers.  

<br/>

Examples:  
*To use it properly*, you must first switch it on.  
My aunty likes *to go on long walks with her dogs*.  
Now is the best time *to start*.  

<br/>  


#### How to identify which part of speech the infinitive is functioning as  
Try each of these in the order in which they appear:  

1. Noun -- replace it with this/that/someone/something  
2. Adverb -- can (often) be moved around the sentence, to the front or back  
3. Adjective -- if it's not a noun or an adverb, chances are it's an adjective
