* A verbal is a verb form used as another part of speech, e.g.:  
adjectives  
nouns  
adverbs  


* The three forms of the verbal are as follows:  
Gerund  (can be subject, predicate nominative, direct object, or object of a preposition)  
Infinitive (used as a noun, adjective, or adverb)   
participle  (used as an adjective to modify nouns and pronouns)  
<br/>  


Examples:  

Do you mind *my <ins>asking</ins> how you knew*?  (Gerund phrase is the object of the sentence. Possesive adjective "my" modifies the gerund (noun) "asking")  

I want *<ins>to take</ins> it back to the store*. (Infinitive phrase acting as a noun. I want *this* -- to take it back to the store)  

*<ins>Having found</ins> the solution*, the team celebrated. (Participle adjective phrase modifing the team)
