title: The dash
---


* When a noun clause is a nonessential appositive, use a dash before it, or place a pair of dashes around it.   


>He delayed telling her the obvious -- that he was afraid of spiders -- and kept up the pretence all afternoon.  


Dashes are used in the above example, and other such sentences, when commas are not strong enough to separate nonessential elements.  

Use a dash at the end of a sentence to rename the subject.   

Example:  
That's his reason for leaving the door open -- to let in some fresh air.
