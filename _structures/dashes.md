reword - when a noun clause is a nonessential appositive, use a dash before it or a pait of dashes around it.  

She delayed telling him the obvious -- that she was leaving -- and put their financial situation into chaos.  

The thing is this is where we see grammar rules about dashes in bggp. Not just for change of focus in a sentence but in any semtence this is the case.  

Dashes used in the above example when commas are not strong enough to to separate non essential elements.  

Also at the end of a sentence to remane the subject.   

Example:  
That s his reason for leaving -- that he'd been offered a better job.
