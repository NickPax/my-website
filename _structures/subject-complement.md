Compare with appositive. 

Subject complement is either. 
Noun. 
Adjective. 
Pronoun. 

It follows a linking verb or to be. 
Linking verbs:

Seem
Smells

Examples. 
It is he. 
He is a driver. 
He looks tired.

Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work . (Thomas A Edison, 1847-1931)
(Remember that adjectives and nouns can come in the forms of adjective phrases and noun phrases too.)

(Issue 1) Don't use an adverb as a subject complement.
A subject complement is an adjective, noun, or pronoun. It's never an adverb.
This soup tastes badly.
(Tastes is a linking verb. Badly is an adverb, which can't be used as a subject complement.)
This soup tastes bad. 
(Bad is an adjective.). 

My dog smells bad. üêï 
Ok because bad is an adjective. 
And smells, a linking verb, links the subject, dog, with the adjective bad.   
we can't use an adverb, such as badly, as a subject complement.  

Issue 2) You can say "It is I" or "It is me."
Those who insist on writing "It is I" or "It was he" have tradition on their side because subject complements were traditionally written in the subjective case (e.g., I, she, and he) not in the objective case (e.g, me, her and him). However, those who'd rather write "It is me" or "It was him" have common usage on their https://www.grammar-monster.com/images/Key Points

Use an adjective not an adverb after a linking verb.
She looks amazingly. 
She looks amazing.

When two words, clauses, or phrases stand close together and share the same part of the sentence, they are in apposition and are called appositives.

In fact, an appositive is very much like a subject complement‚Äîwithout the linking verb:

Subject complement
My brother is a research associate.
Appositive
My brother the research associate works at a large polling firm.
Subject complement
Jean became a magistrate.
Appositive
I have never met Jean the magistrate
