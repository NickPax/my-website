title: The adjective clause
---

Answers the questions **which one?** or **what?** about the noun or pronoun it modifies.  
MWW examples - The driver of the getaway car, whom I cannot describe, did not leave the car.  
The bank that we used had a reputation for integrity.  
We waited for a time when it was convenient for everybody.  

Adjective clauses begin with these words and these words only:  
[table]

| who | which | when |
| whom | that | where |
| whose | 


Adjective clauses that begin with the word that are defining; so no commas should be used.  
MWW Examples: 
I was used to a company that had a full benefit package.  
my example: She's the one I was telling you about. !!!!   


When an adjective clause is far away from the word if modifies in a sentence, use commas for clarity.  

Examples:  
mwwex  
The bank on the corner near my apartment in the city, which has been robbed three times, was just hit again.  

I saw a man near the corner just a few seconds before the accident, who was running into the street.  

The agreement between the two parties at the inception of the partnership, which did not contain a valid signature, was null and void.
