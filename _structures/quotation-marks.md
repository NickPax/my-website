Use italics for larger bodies of work that may contain smaller units:  
books, newspapers, magazines, plays, operas, cartoons, periodicals  
e.g. *Hamilton*, *Time*  


Use quotation marks for the following **compositions**:  
songs, short stories, reports, essays, poems, chapters, articles  
e.g. "Freebird"


However the following **compositions** should be italicized:  
movies, TV programs, statues, paintings, sculptures  
e.g. *Batman*

Also use initial capitals for the names ships, trains, spacecraft as regards the class or make:  
e.g. DC-10, Pendolino  

But the individual names of ships, trains, etc should be italicized:
e.g. USS *Nimitz*

Morson's says that sometimes what should and should not be quoted is very subtle. "In some cases it does not matter which way the reporter writes the line."  
E.g.  
Q What did you say?  
A I said no.  
<br>  
Q Please tell us what he said.  
A He said, "No."  
[Note capitalisation]  

When asked how he felt, the defendant said okay.  
When asked how he felt, the defendant said, "Okay."  

Use quotation marks as much as possible for clarity.  And don't forget to paragraph the speakers in exchanges between two or more speakers in direct quotations.  

 <hr>  
 If a word or phrase is quoted or italicized and is then repeated, do not continue to quote or italicize after the first instance.  
 
 
 <hr>
 
 Do not put thoughts or wishes in quotes but do capitalize the first word of the expression.  
 E.g. I thought, My goodness, he's fast.  
 I wondered: How is that done?
