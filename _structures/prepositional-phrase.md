title: Prepositional Phrase
---

* Consists of the preposition itself, its object, and anything that modifies said object.  
* Functions as an **adjective** when it answers the questions *which one?* or *what?*  
* Functions as an **adverb** when it answers the questions *when?* *where?* *why?* or *how?* 
* Always starts with the preposition and ends with the next noun, pronoun, gerund, or clause.  
* The noun that ends a prepositional phrase is called **the object of the preposition**. 
* AKA "phrasal preposition" when it's more than one word.

### The prepositional phrase can also act as a noun sometimes.
However this quite rare. When acting as a noun, the prepositional phrase acts as the subject of the sentence or as a [subject complement]({{site.baseurl}}/structures/subject-complement).  

Examples:  
*Behind the refrigerator* is usually where he hides it. (subject)  
The place where he ususally hides it is *behind the refrigerator*. (subject compliment)

Sometimes you can place an implied noun in front of the prepositional phrase: (A spot) behind the refrigerator ...
