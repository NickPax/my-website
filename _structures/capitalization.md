## Court Systems and Capitalization  
Can vary depending on region.  

Capitalize *court* only when it refers to a judge.  
E.g. There will be a Court ruling in 20 minutes.  
This will be heard in court later this month.  

Capitalize only specific courts, not general ones.  
E.g. This will be tried in District Court tomorrow.  
A district court will try this.  

Only capitalize *counsel* in direct address and as a name title.  

Only capitalize *district attorney*  when it refers to the political entity, not to a local office or deputy. The single elected official for a jurisdiction should be capped.
