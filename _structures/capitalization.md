Examples:  
<br>  

Do not capitalize directions.  
E.g. The lines ran north and south.  

One half of the earth's water  

I have a hearing in the superior court.  

Job titles uncapped unless in direct address.  
Degree titles uncapped unless they following the name.  
Course names uncapped unless the word is always capped or followed by a course number.  

She has a Bachelor of Arts in Fine Art.  
The bachelor's course took time to complete.  

Cap President, Vice President, Senato, Attorney General, etc when at national level or in foreign governments.  


## Court Systems and Capitalization  
Can vary depending on region.  


*Plaintiff* and *defendant* are capped when referring to the case at hand. [BGGP differs from this and does not cap, e.g., *defendant* even if in relation to the case at hand.]  Also this is court reporter preference.

Capitalize *court* only when it refers to a judge.  
E.g. There will be a Court ruling in 20 minutes.  
This will be heard in court later this month.  

Capitalize only specific courts, not general ones.  
E.g. This will be tried in District Court tomorrow.  
A district court will try this.  

Only capitalize *counsel* in direct address and as a name title.  

Only capitalize *district attorney*  when it refers to the political entity, not to a local office or deputy. The single elected official for a jurisdiction should be capped.  

Regarding the word *state*  
Unless it is written with the actual state, e.g., *State of Florida*, it should be uncapped.  
However, it is, again, **reporter preference**.  
Please note *state* can be capped by itself when they are a party to the lawsuit (BGGP Capitalization 53, but Morson's 222 says it should not be capped.)
