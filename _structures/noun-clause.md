[google some examples if you're too tired to make some up]

Only these eleven words (some with an added -ever) can start a noun clause.


| who | whom | whose | 
| which | that | when |
| where | whether | why |
| how | what |  


We don't normally need to punctuate for a noun clause unless we're dealing with appositives [see chapter 21] or noun clauses that are not in the normal position. [give examples]
