title: The adverb clause
---

Answers question **when? where? why? how?**    

mwwex: I sent that email so that she and I could maybe talk about the problem.  

Always begins with a subordinate conjunction.  

#### Comma Talk  

If the clause is **not directly related to the content**, it can take a comma before it.  
Here are common words starting such a clause:  


| though | as though | although |
| even though | as if | even if |
| if |  


mwwex:  
# compare these:  
>She will be here in four months if she needs to be.  
>She will be here in four months, if I remember the date correctly.  

>He made the attempt even though it was difficult.  
>He made the attempt, even though no one expected him to succeed.  

<br/>  

An adverb clause at the end of a sentence usually does not require punctuation.

Example:

He looked up because of the noise it made.

And when the adverb clause comes after a noun clause -- even in the middle of a sentence -- add no punctuation.

Example:

Where he went after the meeting nobody knows.

And when an adverb clause comes after another adverb clause at the end of a sentence, again use no punctuation.

Example:

Mr Brigstock was looking confident as he praticed the riff before going on stage.

HOWEVER ...

If the adverb clause is not directly related to the content of the part of the sentence in which it is used, add a comma.

Examples:

The firm has a no-smoking policy throughout the campus, even though no one really smokes these days.

The team had organised a huge ad hoarding and placed the content in full view, although you couldn't really see it because the font was too small.
