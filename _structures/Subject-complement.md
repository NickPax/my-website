Replace these copy/pastes:

Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work . (Thomas A Edison, 1847-1931)
(Remember that adjectives and nouns can come in the forms of adjective phrases and noun phrases too.)

(Issue 1) Don't use an adverb as a subject complement.
A subject complement is an adjective, noun, or pronoun. It's never an adverb.
This soup tastes badly.
(Tastes is a linking verb. Badly is an adverb, which can't be used as a subject complement.)
This soup tastes bad. 
(Bad is an adjective.). 

Issue 2) You can say "It is I" or "It is me."
Those who insist on writing "It is I" or "It was he" have tradition on their side because subject complements were traditionally written in the subjective case (e.g., I, she, and he) not in the objective case (e.g, me, her and him). However, those who'd rather write "It is me" or "It was him" have common usage on their side
