title: Subordinate Conjunction
---
* Links a dependent clause of which it is a part to an independent clause.    
* Most begin dependent clauses that function as adverbs.    
* Some can begin noun or adjective clauses.    
<br/>


Here are some common subordinate conjunctions:

| after | even if | than |
| although | even though | though|
| as | if | unless |
| as far as | in order that | until |
| as soon as | once | when |
| as though | provided (that) | whereas |
| because | since | whether |
| before | so (that) | while |  

<br/>  

Examples:  
I like red (<ins>whereas</ins> you like yellow).    
It was quite hot (<ins>although</ins> it was raining).
>Note: These sentences do not contain commas! But check below for when there are commas before these words.

## Important contradiction
Whereas and although are <ins>adverbs of concession</ins>, along with though and even though.
Think of them as "but" when a dependent clause contrasts with the main clause. In this case there is a comma before them.  
Examples:  
>I played the bass, whereas John played the keys.
