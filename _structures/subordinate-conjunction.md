title: Subordinate Conjunction
---  


* Links a dependent clause of which it is a part to an independent clause.  

Let's go ***as soon as** they arrive*.  
{: .greybg}
<br>
* Most subordinate conjunctions begin dependent clauses that function as adverbs.  

Flowers bloom ***when** spring arrives*.  
{: .greybg}
<br>

* Some subordinate conjunctions can begin noun or adjective clauses.    
Many noun clauses begin with **that**.  

I can see ***that** you're fine now*. [direct object]  
{: .greybg}
<br>

* Sometimes, **that** can be left out:  

I can see *you're fine now*.  
{: .greybg}
<br>
# Subordinate conjunctions beginning noun phrases acting as different parts of speech:  

***Where** we go tomorrow* is up to you. [subject]  

Can you see ***which** one is flashing*? [indirect object]  

Let's talk about ***how** quickly you covered the area last Tuesday night*. [object of preposition]

Your assumption ***that** Jordy hid the files* is incorrect. [appositive]

The problem is ***that** we're lost*. [subject complement]

They announced the winner ***whoever** got back first*. [object complement]

Call me ***whatever** you want*. [object complement]

Here are some common subordinate conjunctions:

| after | even if | than |
| although | even though | though|
| as | if | unless |
| as far as | in order that | until |
| as soon as | once | when |
| as though | provided (that) | whereas |
| because | since | whether |
| before | so (that) | while |  

<br/>  

Examples:  
   
It was quite hot (<ins>although</ins> it was raining).  


Note: These sentences do not contain commas! But check below for when there are commas before these words.

## Important contradiction
Whereas and although are <ins>adverbs of concession</ins>, along with though and even though.
Think of them as "but" when a dependent clause contrasts with the main clause. In this case there is a comma before them.  
Examples:  
>I played the bass, whereas John played the keys.
