title: The appositive
published: true
---


It's something that renames something else.  
e.g. The boss, Brian, was kind.  
So when the appositive immediately follows the word that it renames (in the above case, boss) use a comma. However, if the appositive is very short, no commas are necessary (if readability is fine):    
E.g. Bill's little sister Jane is taller than you, Jimmy.

If it is not right next to the word it renames, still use commas if in the middle of the sentence:
E.g. He needed to stay alert, the bouncer, as a few troublemakers had arrived. 

But it might be **very** far away in the sentence:
E.g. It started to make a funny noise half way through the gig -- my brand new Les Paul guitar.

Key point: the farther away the appositive, the more likely you are going to need dashes rather than commas.


It can be a word, words, phrase, or even a whole clause:
E.g. How embarrasing that was on the night of our big gig -- that I forgot the chords to the song!  

If the appositive comes at the end, after the sentence has finished, use a dash before it:  
They cherred and clapped enthusiastically -- the crowd.   

Use commas or dashes to set off a nonessential noun clause appositive if it immediately comes after the noun it renames:  
E.g. The issue -- what to have for breakfast -- was quickly resolved.  
The issue, what to have for breakfast, was quickly resolved.  

Sometimes the appositive comes first. Use a dash:  
E.g. The tall guy at the back -- he can see clearly.

Big one: If the appositive is a defining noun clause, don't use any punctuation:  
E.g. The statement that she knew nothing about the alarm wiring is not true.  

But when it's non-defining (look for words like why, how when, whether, etc) use commas or dashes:  
E.g. The question, why he felt it was the right thing to do, remains unanswered.  

If the appositive contains punctuation, use dashes:  
E.g. The notes she tried to hit -- top C, D, and F -- were just to high.  

If a noun appositive comes before the word it renames, use a dash.  
E.g.: The piano -- did youy buy it?  

However it is also possible to use a comma.
E.g.: This bag, does it belong to you?

### Parentheticals  

If the parenthetical is followed by a fragment, set off the parenthetical with commas.  
E.g. It was a week night, that is, a Wednesday.  

If the parenthetical is follwed by a complete sentence, use a semicolon with a comma after it.  
E.g. It was a week night; that is, it was a Wednesday.  

If the parenthetical is followed by a list, use a colon and comma:  
E.g. They followed a strict schedule of days: that is [or i.e.], Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  

If there is a parenthetical in the middle of the sentence before an appositive list, use dashes, and a comma after the parenthetical:  
E.g. The notes she tried to hit -- that is, top C, D, and F -- were just too high.
