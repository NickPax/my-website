It's something that renames something else.  
e.g. The boss, Brian, was kind.  

If it is not right next to the word it renames, still use commas if in the middle of the sentence:
e.g. He needed to stay alert, the bouncer, as a few trouble makers had arrived. 

But it might be **very** far away in the sentence:
e.g. It started to make a funny noise half way through the gig -- my brand new Les Paul guitar.

Key point: the farther away the appositive, the more likely you are going to need dashes rather than commas.


It can be a word, words, phrase, or even a whole clause:
e.g. How embarrasing that was on the night of our big gig -- that I forgot the chords to the song!  

If the appositive comes at the end, after the sentence has finished, use a dash before it:  
They cherred and clapped enthusiastically -- the crowd.  

Sometimes the appositive comes first. Use a dash:  
e.g. The tall guy at the back -- he can see clearly.

Big one: If the appositive is a defining noun clause, don't use any punctuation:  
e.g. The statement that she knew nothing about the alarm wiring is not true.  
But when it's non-defining (look for words like why, how when, whether, etc) use commas or dashes:  
e.g. The question, why he felt it was the right thing to do, remains unanswered.  

If the appositive contains punctuation, use dashes:  
e.g. The notes she tried to hit -- top C, D, and F -- were just to high.
