title: Do not punctuate here
---  

Between subject and verb.  
E.g. The fact that they so openly and brazenly walked into the cinema after the main event had happened [NO COMMA] didn't phase us.  

Before a coordinate conjunction joining parts that could not stand alone as complete thoughts.  
E.g. Jim was ready to move [NO COMMA] and up for the journey [NO COMMA] but not quite awake yet.  

After a single-syllable conjunctive adverb.  
E.g. So how's it going?
