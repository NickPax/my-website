**Ken Wick's YouTube video "055 top 10 differences Between LMEG and BGGP"** (links below)    


This is great as it goes through important differences.   Also includes differnces between CMOS and GRM.  
<br>

"BGGP" means Margie Wakeman Wells' *Bad Grammar Good Punctuation*.  

"LMEG" means *Morson's English Guide*.  

"GRM" means *Gregg's Reference Manual*.  

"CMOS" means *The Chicago Manual of Style*  

<br>

Ken says he found 47 differences among LMEG, BGGP, and GRM in his book *99 Essential Rules*.  
I list Ken's top 10 below:

|BGGP|LMEG|

**Words or Figures with "o'clock"**  

|BGGP|LMEG|
|Use figures and ciphers (zeros) before o'clock.|Use words before o'clock.|

**Adjacent Numbers**  

|BGGP|LMEG|GRM|
|Use a space when written out or a hyphen with figures.|Hyphen|Use a comma with either words or figures.|
|Jan is six three.|Jan is six-three.|Jan is six, three.|
|Jan is 6-3||Jan is 6,3|


In the "Top Ten Differences" video, Ken says that LMEG allows two adjacent figures to be separated by "a comma or other punctuation." However Rule 203 in LMEG states that *[i]f* a comma or other punctuation separates the two numerical expressions, digits may be used for both expressions. Here Morson is saying that the former case is an exception and that usually "[i]f two numerical expressions come together, write one expression as a figure and write one expression as a word." She then gives three examples, including this one: "It's 4 months times 400. That's 12 weeks times 400: $4,800 roughly."

See "Video 033: Numbers (Part 3)" above.
