<br>
Also includes differences between CMOS and GRM.  
<br>  

DEFINITIONS:  

"BGGP" means Margie Wakeman Wells' *Bad Grammar Good Punctuation*.  

"LMEG" means *Morson's English Guide*.  

"GRM" means *Gregg's Reference Manual*.  

"CMOS" means *The Chicago Manual of Style*  
<br> 

Ken says he found 47 differences among LMEG, BGGP, and GRM in his book *99 Essential Rules*.  
Below are Ken's top 10 differences:  

(1)

## "v." in Legal Citations {#one}  


|BGGP|LMEG|

{% include youtube.html id='teBm6tWVPSE' %} 

<br>
(3) 

## End of sentence one-word questions using *right*, *correct*, or *true*  {#three}

|BGGP|LMEG|GRM|
|semicolon|period, semicolon, or comma|comma|
|That's all you saw; correct?|That's all you saw. Correct?|That's all you saw, correct?|
||That's all you saw; correct?||
||That's all you saw, correct?||  

{% include youtube.html id='h6batTLKKEM' %}  

<br>
(4)  

## Questions that follow forms of *to be* {#four}  

|BGGP|LMEG GRM CMOS|
|Use colon if introduced by independent clause|Use colon if introduced by independent clause or for emphasis|
|Otherwise, no comma||
|My question is this: Were you awake at the time?|My question is this: Were you awake at the time?|
|My question is were you awake at the time?| My question is, Were you awake at the time?|  

{% include youtube.html id='gNwIB7Hld1s' %}

## Colon before Quotation {#five} 

|BGGP|LMEG|GRM|CMOS|
|If the quotation is very long (block-formatted quotation) or very formal (a judgement call)|If the quotation is "formal", e.g., legal or historical docs, speeches, etc.|If the quotation is introduced by an independent clause or it's more than one sentence|If the quotation is introduced by an independent clause. Colon may replace comma if used consistently.|
|*Counsel made a very good statement to the jury, "Gather facts and decide the case in the deliberation room."|*Counsel made a very good statement to the jury, "Gather facts and decide the case in the deliberation room."|Counsel made a very good statement to the jury: "Gather facts and decide the case in the deliberation room."|Counsel made a very good statement to the jury: "Gather facts and decide the case in the deliberation room."|  

\* I would disagree with Ken here as regards BGGP's and LMEG's treatment of the above example sentence.  
In BGGP Rule 10.2 The Colon: An Indication of Something Coming, the discussion section under the rule provides the following example: *He read it to us as follows: "You are to report at 9:00 on the 27th."*
Also in the rule Quotes.15, BGGP states this: *Base the punctuation in front of quotation marks on the grammar in the sentence rather than the quote marks themselves.*  
LMEG, in Rule 278 Examples, provides the following sentence: *As a teacher and writer, these words I try to live by: "I'm careful of the words I say, / to keep them short and sweet. / I never know from day to day / Which ones I'll have to eat."*  

I realize that these examples are not quoted *speech*, and so maybe I'm wrong about this. However they *are* quotations.

## Spoken Punctuation using Quote, Close Quote {#six}  

|BGGP|LMEG|
|Use commas around spoken puntuation *and* quotation marks|Either commas around spoken punctuation and no quotation marks, or just quotation marks and no spoken punctuation|
|My manager told me to, quote, "persuade," close quote, the client.|My manager told me to, quote, persuade, close quote, the client.|
||My manager told me to "persuade" the client.|  

See "Video 021: Quotation Marks (Part 1)" above.

(7)  

## Words or Figures with "o'clock" {#seven}  

|BGGP|LMEG|
|Use figures and ciphers (zeros) before o'clock.|Use words before o'clock.|
The alarm went off at 6:00 o'clock.|The alarm went off at six o'clock.|  

{% include youtube.html id='JqcUbRBg1d4' %}  

<br>
(8)  

## Adjacent Numbers {#eight} 

|BGGP|LMEG|GRM|
|Use a space when written out or a hyphen with figures.|Hyphen|Use a comma with either words or figures.|
|Jan is six three.|Jan is six-three.|Jan is six, three.|
|Jan is 6-3||Jan is 6,3|


In the "Top Ten Differences" video, Ken says that LMEG allows two adjacent figures to be separated by "a comma or other punctuation." However Rule 203 in LMEG states that "*[i]f* a comma or other punctuation separates the two numerical expressions, digits may be used for both expressions." Here Morson is saying that the former case is an exception and that usually "[i]f two numerical expressions come together, write one expression as a figure and write one expression as a word." She then gives three examples, including this one: "It's 4 months times 400. That's 12 weeks times 400: $4,800 roughly."

See "Video 033: Numbers (Part 3)" above.

(9)  

## Compound Adjectives (hyphenation or not) {#nine}  

|BGGP|LMEG|
|Hyphenate when it forms a unit. BGGP has 10 rules of different concepts and situations. Check a standard dictionary.|Use patterns, e.g. adj.+ noun before a noun, *well* + participle before a noun. LMEG has 16 of these compound adjective patterns (see Ken's video no. 44 below). When in doubt, consult a dictionary.
|Example: two-door automobile -- neither a "two automobile" or a "door automobile"; the words are hyphenated to form a unit.||

## Long Compound Adjective {#ten}  

|BGGP|LMEG|
|Use quotation marks when a compound adjective is "something someone might say in a conversation." The longer the saying, the less likely hyphens are going to be clear.|If a hyphenated compound adjective is **six or more words or could be misread**, then enclose it in quotation marks.|

See "Video 044: The Hyphen (Part 4)" above.
